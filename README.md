# TLS 1.3 in Go - Lightweight, Standalone, Dependency-Free

A modern, pure Go implementation of TLS 1.3 — no external
dependencies, no legacy baggage. This library supports both client and
server modes and fully implements the essential "MUST" requirements
from [RFC 8446](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446.html).

Built for developers who want a minimal, transparent, and auditable
TLS 1.3 stack that's easy to embed, test, or extend.
